		<h2>Brief Overview</h2>
		
		<p>Teapot is a decentralised build tool for managing complex cross-platform projects. It has many goals but it is primarily designed to improve the experience for developers trying to make cross-platform applications and libraries with a minimum of overhead.</p>

		<ul class="features">
			<li>Provide useful feedback when dependencies are not met or errors are encountered.</li>
			<li>Decentralised dependency management allows use within private organisations without exposing code.</li>
			<li>Generators can simplify the construction of new projects as well as assist with the development of existing ones.</li>
			<li>The build subsystem provides a simple set of canonical operations for building libraries and executables to minimise configuration overhead.</li>
		</ul>
